/* Notes:
  I did add a few quick notes to the README.MD.
  I also added a few lines between the output t odeliniate the different parts of the program for easier review. I hope this is acceptable.

  Constructor of Roster class object will execute setclassRosterArray method.
  The method will parse the studentArray and set the classRosterArray with pointers to each Student objects created from the student data table.

  I apprciate whomever it is that takes the time to read this! It was most fun writing the c++ code here, I am open to any feedback! 

  Thank you!
